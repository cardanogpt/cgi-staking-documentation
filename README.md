# CardanoGPT Staking Process Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the Cardano staking process for the CGI token. Users can connect their wallets, choose the amount of CGI tokens to stake, and receive an NFT representing the staked CGI. The staked tokens will be locked and can only be unstaked at the end of the chosen period. The locking of tokens and the minting and sending of the NFT will occur in a single transaction. The NFT is transferable and can be sold or bought at will. The NFT will always be worth the amount of CGI in its metadata at the time of maturity.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Cardano wallet (e.g., Eternl, Nami, Vespr) with a balance of CGI tokens.
- Access to the internet and a web browser.

## Wallet Connection
1. Navigate to the staking platform's website.
2. Click on the **Connect Wallet** button.
3. Choose your preferred Cardano wallet from the list.
4. Follow the prompts to authorize the connection.

## Staking CGI Tokens
1. After connecting your wallet, navigate to the staking section.
2. Enter the amount of CGI tokens you wish to stake.
3. Select the staking period from the available options.
4. Review the details and confirm the staking action.
5. Upon confirmation, the CGI tokens will be locked for the chosen period, and an NFT representing your staked amount will be minted and sent to your wallet in a single transaction.

## Receiving the NFT
1. After successfully staking your CGI tokens, an NFT representing your staked amount will be minted.
2. This NFT will be sent to your connected Cardano wallet in the same transaction as the token locking.
3. The NFT serves as proof of your staked CGI tokens and includes details such as the staking amount and the end date of the staking period.
4. The NFT is transferable and can be sold or bought at will. The NFT will always be worth the amount of CGI in its metadata at the time of maturity.

## Unstaking Process
1. At the end of the chosen staking period, you will be eligible to unstake your CGI tokens.
2. Navigate to the unstaking section on the platform.
3. Ensure your wallet is connected.
4. The platform will automatically detect eligible NFTs in your wallet.
5. Select the NFT corresponding to the staking period that has ended.
6. Confirm the unstaking process.
7. The NFT will be burned, and your staked CGI tokens will be returned to your wallet, accrued with rewards earned during the staking period.
